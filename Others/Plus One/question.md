<h2> Plus One </h2>

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

Example 1:<br>

Input: digits = [1,2,3]<br>
Output: [1,2,4]<br>
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.<br>
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.<br>
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

Example 2:<br>

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]<br>
Output: [4,3,2,2]<br>
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.<br>
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.<br>
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].

Example 3:<br>

Input: digits = [9]<br>
Output: [1,0]<br>
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.<br>
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.<br>
Thus, the result should be [1,0].<br>
