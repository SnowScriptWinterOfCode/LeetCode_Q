  Solve with us the most mind-boggling DSA questions to ace your skills

## Why DSA?
Today's World contains lots and lots of data. When you need to deal with the data you must store it somewhere, and storing it doesn’t finish our work right? Because you need to fetch it whenever it is required and perform related operations on it. In what way you store your data has a lot to deal with how fast you can fetch and work on it. If you give your data a proper structure, we can easily perform the required operations on it.

Let us consider Facebook, have you ever wondered how will it work in the background? and how can it show the mutual friends? and all. It is because of the DSA behind the code. For finding mutual friends, can you guess what data structure is used? It is graphs, and with the help of graphs we can work on the connections.
Moreover, it is one of the most important topics to crack the interviews and online assessments for product-based companies.

The data structures used to solve the problems in this repo will be from basics like arrays, and strings to advanced topics like trees and linked lists.

## Where to add the solutions of the leetcode question and in which format
![Alt text](image.png)
If the Question Folder Exists:
-If the assigned question already has a folder within the repository and no one has added a solution:
-Go to the specific question folder.
-Create a new file named solution.cpp or solution.java.
-Add your code for the function part of the question as presented in LeetCode.
-Ensure the code is well-formatted, free of grammar errors, and follows good coding practices.

If the Question Folder Doesn't Exist:
-First ask the project leads once.
-If the assigned question isn't present in any folders:
-Identify the latest day's folder (e.g., Day5).
-Create a new folder with the format q1-NameOfTheQuestion under the latest day's folder.
-Inside this new folder, create a file named solution.cpp or solution.java.
-Add your code for the function part of the question as presented in LeetCode.
-Ensure clarity, remove grammar errors, and format the code neatly, similar to a GitHub README.

The overall goal is to organize solutions by question number and name within the appropriate day's folder. If the question folder already exists, add your solution inside; otherwise, create the folder structure for the new question and include your code there.
