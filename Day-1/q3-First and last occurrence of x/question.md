Given a sorted array arr containing n elements with possibly some duplicate, the task is to find the first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.
Note: If the number x is not found in the array then return both the indices as -1.

Example 1:

Input:
n=9, x=5
arr[] = { 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125 }
Output:
2 5
Explanation:
First occurrence of 5 is at index 2 and last occurrence of 5 is at index 5.
