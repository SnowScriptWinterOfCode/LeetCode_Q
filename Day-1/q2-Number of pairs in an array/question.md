# D1Q2: Number of pairs in an array
Number of Pairs in an Array
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.

A k-diff pair is an integer pair (nums[i], nums[j]), where the following are true:

0 <= i, j < nums.length
i != j
|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k
Notice that |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).

## P.S Do not make changes here while creating a PR!! The solutions will be released from our end and added here.

How to add a solution:
1. In this particular folder, create a file named "githubUsername--language.md" 
[For example, if "bh-g" is creating a solution in Python, Java and C++ then filename should be "bh-g--JPC.md"]
[Similiarly, creating it for only a particular language for example Java would be: "bh-g--J.md"]
2. We will only consider unique approaches 
3. Even if you wish to submit solution in multiple languages such as Java, C++, Python, etc kindly create a single pull request only.
4. Solutions in the form of images will NOT be accepted.
5. Use "```" aka backticks to create a codeblock in your md files, just add them before and after your code 
The following effect is created by codeblocks and we highly recommend it for the sake of clarity. 

```
printf("Hello, World")
```
