# Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find a 
subarray that has the largest product, and return the product. 

## Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
#### Explanation: 
[2,3] has the largest product 6.

## Example 2:

Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]

Output: 0

#### Explanation: 
The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
 

## Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104

-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
