# Linked List Components

You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array nums that is a subset of the linked list values.

Return the number of connected components in nums where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

### Example 1:

Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.

### Example 2:

Input: head = [0,1,2,3,4], nums = [0,3,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
