Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A **leaf** is a node with no children. 
A **left leaf** is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

### **_Example 1_**

![image](https://github.com/SnowScriptWinterOfCode/LeetCode_Q/assets/112773734/82f26aff-30a7-4d6e-91ad-dd0cdc562ff6)

**Input**: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output**: 24
**Explanation**: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.

### **_Example 2_**

**Input**: root = [1]
**Output**: 0
 

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `1000` <= Node.val <= `1000`
