# D5Q3 - Rotate Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
 

Constraints:
n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
1 <= n <= 20
-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000


**Constraints:**

1. n == nums.length
2. 1 <= n <= 5000
3. -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
4. All the integers of nums are unique.
5. nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

## P.S Do not make changes here while creating a PR!! The solutions will be released from our end and added here.

How to add a solution:
1. In this particular folder, create a file named "githubUsername--language.md" 
[For example, if "bh-g" is creating a solution in Python, Java and C++ then filename should be "bh-g--JPC.md"]
[Similiarly, creating it for only a particular language for example Java would be: "bh-g--J.md"]
2. We will only consider unique approaches 
3. Even if you wish to submit solution in multiple languages such as Java, C++, Python, etc kindly create a single pull request only.
4. Solutions in the form of images will NOT be accepted.
5. Use "```" aka backticks to create a codeblock in your md files, just add them before and after your code 

The following effect is created by codeblocks and we highly recommend it for the sake of clarity. 

```
printf("Hello, World")
```
